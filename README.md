This is a proof of concept for zero-shot panoptic segmentation using the [Segment Anything Model (SAM)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything). 

SAM cannot immediately achieve panoptic segmentation due to two limitations:
- The released version of SAM is not text-aware
- The authors of Segment Anything mention that it is unclear how to design simple prompts that implement semantic and panoptic segmentation

To solve these challenges we use the following additional models:
- [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO), a zero-shot object detector
- [CLIPSeg](https://github.com/timojl/clipseg), a zero-shot (binary) segmentation model

Our Frankenstein-ish pipeline looks as follows:

1. Use Grounding DINO to detect the "thing" categories (categories with instances)
2. Get instance segmentation masks for the detected boxes using SAM
3. Use CLIPSeg to obtain rough segmentation masks of the "stuff" categories
4. Sample points in these rough segmentation masks and feed these to SAM to get fine segmentation masks
5. Combine the background "stuff" masks with the foreground "thing" masks to obtain a panoptic segmentation label
